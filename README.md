# GoFundMe Clone with Python / Django to beat censorship, with Paytrace payment gateway and API

Places like GoFundMe, Patreon, Twitter, Facebook, etc., have life threatening allergies to facts and sunlight that exposes them. They've been banning people for extremely stupid reasons, and their double standards can't be trusted.

I made this with your freedom in mind so you can have your own crowdfunding capabilities, in case people in Silicon Valley or wherever decide to ban you for some minor thing they disapprove of.

If you aren't doing anything illegal: Knock yourself out.

## PROGRAM CREATED BY:

Kevin Keable, owner of CipherSanctum.com

## Update 1/5/2024

I'm currently changing my domain from the older CyberHavenProgramming.com to CipherSanctum.com due to potential TM problems I just noticed, and might come up in the future. It was also PwnSauceDesigns at first *(I didn't like that name)*. Either way, I made this, and have no relation to any other businesses with similar names.


## Instructions / Things you will need to do:

[Read instructions on my blog](https://CipherSanctum.com/blog/2019/3/20/beat-censorship-gofundme-crowdfunding-fundraiser-alternative-using-paytrace-api-payment-gateway-python-django/) for a more thorough intro, reasoning, and the functionality to this app.

## ADDITIONAL LEGAL NOTICES:

If you want to use this program, in addition to the LICENSE in this repository, you must also do the following...

1. Give me credit for creating the foundation of this program. I would appreciate a [link back to the instructions](https://CipherSanctum.com/blog/2019/3/20/beat-censorship-gofundme-crowdfunding-fundraiser-alternative-using-paytrace-api-payment-gateway-python-django/) on my website, or the [home page of my website](https://www.CipherSanctum.com/), preferably from the website you run the program on... You don't have to do those, but at the very least, you must put either of those urls in your source code so people can know how to get started *(Example: put the links in the README file, or if you don't have a README file, attribute me somewhere where people will see it, whether on the frontend or backend)*.

That's it!
